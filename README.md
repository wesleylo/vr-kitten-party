# vr-kitten-party
This virtual reality game was built for use with the HTC Vive. Use the grip buttons on the hand controllers to pick up and throw the ball for the kitten to chase. If you stop playing with it for too long, the kitten may become uninterested. Use the touchpads to move around. There is simple sound for now; the kitten will purr when it reaches the ball for the first time. Open the doors by pressing on the trigger buttons.

## Setup
Install SteamVR

Open the game:
```%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Wesley_Lo_Kitten_Party\kitten-party.exe -vrmode openvr```
